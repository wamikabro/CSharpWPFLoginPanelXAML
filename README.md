# CSharpWPFLoginPanelXAML
UI of Login Panel made using WPF.

I couldn't upload the whole project, so I've provided both the codes. The C Sharp code for Backend and XAML code for the Frontend.
I've also provided all the images used in the project, you will simply upload the folder in your WPF Project. 
Also don't forget to convert images into Resources, otherwise images will through run time exception.
